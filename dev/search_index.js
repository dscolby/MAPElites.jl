First, many optimizers get stuck in a local min/maximum searching for a single best solution. Second, a lot of optimizers are unable to balance exploration and exploitation, which can lead them to overlook promising solutions or even get stuck in local optima. Third, almost all  optimization algorithms are not ammenable to understanding the relationship between features and  performance â€” they are bascially just black boxes. And finally, and arguably the biggest motivation,  is that traditional optimization seeks a single best solution for a given situation. However, what  works well in one situation might not be the best solution for another. Quality-diversity algorithms address these shortcomings by searching for a diverse set of high performing solutions, rather  than a single solution. One of the most successful and widely used quality-diversity algorithms  is Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites), which can be categorized as an  evolutionary algorithm. MAP-Elites uses genetic operators to evolve high quality candidate solutions  at each point within a discretized behavior (feature) space, which the user can choose.[1]","category":"page"},{"location":"#Package","page":"Home","title":"Package","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Simplicity at its core: MAPElites.jl is designed to be simple and easy to use. Therefore, it    contains implementations for a diverse but small core set of variants of MAP-Elites to cover a    variety of situations without requiring hard-to-understand abstractions.\nCustomizable: MAPElites.jl lets you use whatever behavior descriptors or fitness functions you    want. You can use any function as a fitness function as long as it returns a real number. This    also makes it easy to mix and match genetic operators, behavior descriptions, and fitness functions,    or write your own.\nLibrary-agnostic: Unlike some Python implementations of quality-diversity algorithms, MAPElites.jl   doesn't require you to use any specific library for arrays or tensors. You are free to use base    Julia, CUDA arrays from CUDA.jl, or any other library. As long as your fitness function can    evaluate your candidate solutions, you can use whatever data structure you want, be it arrays,    strings, images, or anything else.\nWorks with Optimization.jl: The implementations in MAPElites.jl can also be called from within   Optimization.jl (coming soon).","category":"page"},{"location":"#Alternatives","page":"Home","title":"Alternatives","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"There are a few alternatives to MAPElites.jl for quality-diversity algorithms written in Python.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"QDax: A Jax-based implementation of several quality-diversity algorithms mostly designed around    reinforcement learning and robotics.\nPyRibs: A barebones Python implementation that uses an ask-tell interface that also focuses on    reinforcement learning.\nqdpy: A generic minimal implementation of quality-diversity algroithms in Python.\nCVT-MAP-Elites: A simple Python implementation of CVT-MAP-Elites.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Contents","page":"Home","title":"Contents","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#Index","page":"Home","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#MAPElites.AbstractArchive","page":"Home","title":"MAPElites.AbstractArchive","text":"An abstract type that all archives must be subtypes of.
